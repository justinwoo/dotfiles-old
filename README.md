dotfiles
========

collection of my dotfiles to be slowly added to over time...

environment
========

assumes installation of git, ruby, homebrew, and the [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) vim pack.

atom installation optional, even if i don't try to actively maintain my atom configs anymore (mvim replaces atom)

todos
========
symlink my files from ~/dotfiles to ~. there's no reason i should have to copy changes over and manually edit files in github (also helps with actually version controlling config)
